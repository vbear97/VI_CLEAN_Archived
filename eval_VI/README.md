This folder provides the necessary code to visualise and evaluate the results of a Variational Inference algorithm. Specifically, how well does the optimized variational approximation $q_{\phi}(\theta)$ approximate the true posterior distribution $p(\theta | x)$?

NOTE: As of Jan 2023, both files in this folder (vis and diagnose) rely on the input file benchmark_objects, which has not yet been uploaded to github. benchmark_objects will contain the code necessary to generate the posterior approximations using MCMC simulation.
